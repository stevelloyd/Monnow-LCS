# Activity 3 (Think, Actâ€”human robots)

In this activity, one person pretends to be a robot, and another is the program which controls the robot.

- put the bin somewhere in the room (make an interesting route!)
- give the ball to the person who is playing the robot
- the robot can only obey the program instructions given to them, but if their body touches an obstacle in front on them, they must stop until they move in a direction away from the obstacle.

| Command name (what you say to the robot) | Robot's action                                                                    |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Forward                                  | Move one pace forward                                                             |
| Back                                     | Move one pace back                                                                |
| Right                                    | Turn 90 degrees right                                                             |
| Left                                     | Turn 90 degress left                                                              |
| Drop                                     | Raise your arm horizontally (so it's parallel with the ground), and drop the ball |

The aim is to get the ball into the bin. Take turns in being the robot and program.

Are there any other instructions which could be useful?

Are there any problems if more than one robot is working at the same time?
