# Monnow-LCS notes

## Background

These notes describe the computing resources used in the sessions (6 for students, 1 for teacher development) and the ways in which the project creatively evolved as a pragmatic discourse between SL, RT, KMS, staff and particularly the students.

## Original concepts

The original concept was a strongly mobile-robotics centred one, which in full did not survive the initial planning sessions, but many of the underlying ideas did:

- exploring different kinds of sensors
- programming as a means of thinking about the world
- acting on the world with sounds, light

### Session 1

This session introduced the notions of 'Sense', 'Think', 'Act' to be used in creating creatures which can interact with the world.
