# Monnow-LCS notes

## Background

These notes describe the computing resources used in the sessions (6 for students, 1 for teacher development) and the ways in which the project creatively evolved as a pragmatic discourse between SL, RT, KMS, staff and particularly the students.

The document is written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) â€” a plain text markup format (wrangling Word is far too complicated a task for a life of a mere four score years and ten) You can get the meaning of the file in a plain text editor (eg Notepad-Windows), but to get the full formatting, use a Markdown editor such as [Texts](http://www.texts.io/features/) on Windows, or one of the myriad of equivalents on macOS/iOS eg [Byword](https://bywordapp.com).

## Sessions

### Session 1

This session introduced the notions of 'Sense', 'Think', 'Act' to be used in creating creatures which can interact with the world.
